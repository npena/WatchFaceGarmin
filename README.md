# Gemini Thinking with 3 Pro 
## Prompt 
I want to create a Watch Face for the Garmin Forerunner 165, that looks like a Mondaine watch.

Do everything perfectly so I can send it to my watch as easily and quickly as possible.

I'm on Windows, and I have a Samsung Galaxy S25+. I have VS Code.

## Environment 
1. Install Java JDK Version 17 is standard (https://adoptium.net/)
2. Install the VS Code Extension: "Monkey C" by Garmin
3. Download SDK
- `Ctrl + Shift + P` in VS Code
